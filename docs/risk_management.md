# Risk Management

## Risk Management Steps:

1.  Identify Risks
	- [A] is a risk because [B].
2.  Map Out Impact Versus Likelihood
	- What are the chances that [A] happens?
3.  Plan Your Risk Response
	- What can I do to lower the chances of [A]?
4.  Assign an Owner to the Risk
	- [story object] is where this risk lies.
5.  Understand Your Triggers.
	-  [a,b,c] are things that can cause this risk to arise.
6.  Make a Backup Plan
	-  If [A] is unavoidable, how can we work around it/ what could we do instead of [A].
7.  Measure Your Risk Threshold
	- Keeping track of [A], what are the chances that the alternatives are less likely to become risks?

## Avoidance Plan:
There are several steps that are incorporated into our avoidance plan to ensure that risks are prevented. The first step is to use rich forms of communication and incorporate stakeholder jargon. This step is incorporated to ensure that all stakeholders understand the current state of the project and no misunderstandings develop as a consequence of differences in communication. The second step is to involve stakeholders in backlog grooming. This will be conducted in Sponsor meetings. The team will involve stakeholders in backlog grooming by writing stories into ZenHub during meetings as requirements are discovered during meetings. Additionally, during meetings, the team will review the stories that are being moved into the backlog with sponsors. Finally demonstrations will be used frequently in stakeholder meetings to ensure that all stakeholders are able to get a thorough understanding of the project, avoiding discrepancies in communication. In terms of development, risks will be mitigated by creating prototypes frequently. Furthermore, any development concerns or needs will be discussed early to prevent them from becoming risks. Should a concern arise, the stakeholders will be notified as early as possible.

## Mitigation Plan:
The first step in the mitigation plan is to notify all stakeholders of the risk. This is essential to determine the best track to take in mitigating the impact of the risk. The second step involved in the mitigation plan is to better understand the reason that the risk emerged, the urgency of resolving the risk, and the severity of the risk. Once such parameters have been observed, the stakeholders will communicate potential solutions using rich communication. This will allow all stakeholders to actively share ideas and their own understanding regarding how to overcome the risk. Once a solution has been proposed, the next step is to form a step-by-step plan to mitigate the risk. Such steps incorporated in this plan will include resolving the thing that caused the risk, reducing its impact as early as possible, and forming next steps to prevent the risk. The plan will then be discussed with all stakeholders to determine the value of the plan. Next, the plan will be executed by the development team. Should the plan to resolve the risk fail, stakeholders will be notified of this, and the previous steps will be taken again to determine alternative methods to mitigate the risk.

## Recovery Plan:
The first step in our recovery plan to overcome roadblocks is to notify stakeholders of the roadblock. Upon notifying stakeholders of the roadblock, the team and stakeholders will discuss the problem areas, the reason for the roadblock, the urgency of the roadblock, and consequences of the roadblock. Upon forming an understanding of these things, the stakeholders will discuss solutions for the roadblock. Additional solutions shall be discussed should the initial solution fail to resolve the roadblock. Examples of solutions may be adjustment of system requirements or retrospectives to analyze non-valuable behaviors. Additionally, the solution should work to remedy the impact that the roadblock has already caused. The stakeholders will then decide on a plan to execute. Should this not be effective, the alternative strategies will be employed to overcome the roadblock. This process will be followed until a solution is effectively deployed.
