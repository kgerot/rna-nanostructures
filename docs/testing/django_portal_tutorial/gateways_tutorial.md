# Gateways Tutorial

Objective: learn the basics of the Apache Airavata Django Portal and how to make
both simple and complex customizations to the user interface.

## Prerequisites

Tutorial attendees should have:

-   a laptop on which to write Python code
-   Git client
-   [Docker desktop for Windows and macOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    or
    [Docker Engine for Linux](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community)

!!! note "Special note for Windows Home users"

    If you have Windows Home installed, you'll need to either use a **remote
    Docker host** (recommended) or take some extra steps to setup WSL2
    (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2). The following are some special
    instructions to help you with these options:

    1. (**Recommended**) For the in person session of the tutorial, you will
    have the option of using a **remote Docker host** provided to you. See
    [Appendix: Setting up Windows Home for a remote Docker
    host](#appendix-setting-up-windows-for-a-remote-docker-host) for more
    details.
    2. (**Advanced**) [Install Docker Desktop on Windows Home with WSL2
    enabled](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/).
    See the link for more information.

## Hands on: run a Gaussian computational experiment in the Django portal

### Log into testdrive.airavata.org

First, you'll need a user account. For the in person tutorial we'll have a set
of pre-created usernames and passwords to use. If you are unable to attend the
in person tutorial or would otherwise like to create your own account, go to the
[Create Account](https://testdrive.airavata.org/auth/create-account) page and
select **Sign in with existing institution credentials**. This will take you to
the CILogon institution selection page. If you don't find your institution
listed here, go back to the _Create Account_ page and fill out the form to
create an account with a username, password, etc.

Once you have an account,
[log into the Airavata Testdrive portal](https://testdrive.airavata.org/auth/login).

After you've logged in, an administrator can grant you access to run the
Gaussian application. During the tutorial we'll grant you access right away and
let you know. If you're at the in person tutorial and using a pre-created
username and password, you should already have all of the necessary
authorizations.

When you log in for the first time you will see a list of applications that are
available in this science gateway. Applications that you are not able to run are
greyed out but the other ones you can run. Once you are granted access, refresh
the page and you should now see that you the _Gaussian16_ application is not
greyed out.

### Submit a test job

From the dashboard, click on the **Gaussian16** application. The page title is
_Create a New Experiment_.

Here you can change the _Experiment Name_, add a _description_ or select a
different project if you have multiple projects.

We'll focus on the _Application Inputs_ for this hands-on. The Gaussian
application requires one input, an _Input-File_. The following is a
preconfigured Gaussian input file. Download this to your local computer and then
click the **Browse** button to upload the file:

-   [npentane12diol.inp](./data/npentane12diol.inp)

You can click on **View File** to take a quick look at the file.

Now we'll select what account to charge and where to run this job. The
_Allocation_ field should already have _Default Gateway Profile_ selected. Under
_Compute Resource_ make sure you select **comet.sdsc.edu**.

Then click **Save and Launch**.

You should then be taken to the _Experiment Summary_ page which will update as
the job progresses. When the job finishes you'll be able to download the `.log`
file which is the primary output file of the gaussian application.

We'll come back to this experiment later in the tutorial.

## Tutorial exercise: customize the input user interface for an application

For this exercise we'll define an application based on the Computational Systems
Biology Group's [_eFindSite_](http://www.brylinski.org/efindsite) drug-binding
site detection software. We'll use this application to demonstrate how to
customize the user interface used for application inputs.

### Basic application configuration

1. In the portal, click on the dropdown menu at the top right (currently
   **Workspace** is likely selected) and select **Settings**.

![Screenshot of Settings menu](./screenshots/gateways19/settings_menu.png)

2. You should see the _Application Catalog_. Click on the **New Application**
   button.
3. For _Application Name_ provide `eFindSite-<your username>`. Appending your
   username will allow you to distinguish your version of _eFindSite_ from other
   users.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Click on the **Interface** tab.
6. This application has 4 command line inputs. We'll add them now. To add the
   first one, click on **Add application input** and provide the following
   information:
    - _Name_: `Target ID`
    - _Type_: STRING (which is the default)
    - _Application Argument_: `-i`
    - _User Friendly Description_: `3-10 alphanumerical characters.`
    - _Required_: `True`
    - _Required on Command Line_: `True`

![Screenshot of Target ID configuration](./screenshots/gateways19/eFindSite-target-id.png)

7. Add the next three application inputs in the same way, using the values in
   the table below:

| Name                  | Type   | Application Argument | Required | Required on Command Line |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Target Structure      | URI    | `-s`                 | True     | True                     |
| Screening libraries   | STRING | `-l`                 | False    | True                     |
| Visualization scripts | STRING | `-v`                 | False    | True                     |

(In Airavata, files are represented as URIs. When an application input has type
_URI_ it means that a file is needed for that input. From a UI point of view,
this essentially means that the user will be able to upload a file for inputs of
type URI.)

Normally we would also define the output files for this application, but for
this exercise we are only interested in exploring the options available in
customizing the application inputs and we won't actually run this application.
We need to register a _deployment_ to be able to invoke this application. An
application deployment includes the details of how and where an application is
installed on a compute resource. Since we won't actually run this application,
we'll just create a dummy deployment so that we can invoke it from the Workspace
Dashboard.

8. Click **Save** at the bottom of the screen.
9. Click on the **Deployments** tab.
10. Click on the **New Deployment** button. Select the _mike.hpc.lsu.edu_
    compute resource in the drop down list and click **OK**.
11. For the _Application Executable Path_, provide the value `/usr/bin/true`.
    This is the only required field.
12. Click **Save** at the bottom of the screen.
13. Use the top level menu to go back to the **Workspace**. You should see your
    _eFindSite_ application listed there.
14. Click on your _eFindSite_ application.

If you see a form with the inputs that we registered for the application
(_Target ID_, etc.) then you have successfully registered the application
interface.

### Improving the application input user interface

There are a few things to point out now:

-   the _Screening libraries_ and _Visualization scripts_ only accept specific
    values. For example, one of the allowed values for _Screening libraries_ is
    `screen_drugbank`
-   the _Target ID_ input takes a string value, but only certain characters
    (alphanumeric) are allowed and the string value has a minimum and maximum
    allowed length.

We can make this user interface more user friendly by providing more guidance in
the application inputs' user interface. For the _Screening libraries_ and
_Visualization scripts_ we'll provide a list of labeled checkboxes for the user
to select. For the _Target ID_ we'll provide validation feedback that verifies
that the given value has an allowed length and only allowed characters.

1. Go back to **Settings** and in the **Application Catalog** click on your
   eFindSite application.
2. Click on the **Interface** tab.
3. For _Target ID_, in the _Advanced Input Field Modification Metadata_ box, add
   the following JSON configuration:

```json
{
    "editor": {
        "validations": [
            {
                "type": "min-length",
                "value": 3
            },
            {
                "type": "max-length",
                "value": 10
            },
            {
                "message": "Target ID may only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.",
                "type": "regex",
                "value": "^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"
            }
        ],
        "ui-component-id": "string-input-editor"
    }
}
```

It should look something like this:

![Screenshot of Target ID JSON customization](./screenshots/gateways19/eFindSite-target-id-json.png)

This JSON configuration customizes the input editor in two ways:

-   it adds 3 validations: min-length, max-length and a regex
-   it sets the UI component of the input editor to be the `string-input-editor`
    (which is also the default)

4. Likewise for _Screening Libraries_, set the _Advanced Input Field
   Modification Metadata_ to:

```json
{
    "editor": {
        "ui-component-id": "checkbox-input-editor",
        "config": {
            "options": [
                {
                    "text": "BindingDB",
                    "value": "screen_bindingdb"
                },
                {
                    "text": "ChEMBL (non-redundant, TC<0.8)",
                    "value": "screen_chembl_nr"
                },
                {
                    "text": "DrugBank",
                    "value": "screen_drugbank"
                },
                {
                    "text": "KEGG Compound",
                    "value": "screen_keggcomp"
                },
                {
                    "text": "KEGG Drug",
                    "value": "screen_keggdrug"
                },
                {
                    "text": "NCI-Open",
                    "value": "screen_nciopen"
                },
                {
                    "text": "RCSB PDB",
                    "value": "screen_rcsbpdb"
                },
                {
                    "text": "ZINC12 (non-redundant, TC<0.7)",
                    "value": "screen_zinc12_nr"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

This JSON configuration specifies a different UI component to use as the input
editor, the `checkbox-input-editor`. It also provides a list of text/value pairs
for the checkboxes; the values are what will be provided to the application as
command line arguments.

5. Similarly for the _Visualization scripts_, provide the following JSON
   configuration:

```json
{
    "editor": {
        "ui-component-id": "checkbox-input-editor",
        "config": {
            "options": [
                {
                    "text": "VMD",
                    "value": "visual_vmd"
                },
                {
                    "text": "PyMOL",
                    "value": "visual_pymol"
                },
                {
                    "text": "ChimeraX",
                    "value": "visual_chimerax"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

6. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.
7. Now, go back to the **Workspace** and on the Dashboard click on your
   _eFindSite_ application. The _application inputs_ form should now reflect
   your changes.
8. Try typing an invalid character (for example, `#`) in _Target ID_. Also try
   typing in more than 10 alphanumeric characters. When an invalid value is
   provided the validation feedback informs the user of the problem so that the
   user can correct it.

### Additional application input customizations

Other
[UI components](https://github.com/apache/airavata-django-portal/tree/master/django_airavata/apps/workspace/static/django_airavata_workspace/js/components/experiment/input-editors)
are available:

-   textarea
-   radio buttons
-   dropdown

We're working to provide a way for custom input editors to be added by the
community, especially domain specific input editors. For example, a ball and
stick molecule editor or a map view for selecting a bounding box of a region of
interest.

Also you can define dependencies between application inputs and show or hide
inputs based on the values of other inputs.

## Tutorial exercise: Create a custom output viewer for an output file

By default, the Django portal provides a very simple view for output files that
allows users to download the file to their local machine. However, it is
possible to provide additional custom views for output files. Examples include:

-   image (visualization)
-   link (perhaps to another web application that can visualize the file)
-   chart
-   parameterized notebook

To be able to create a custom output viewer we'll need to write some Python
code. First, we'll get a local version of the Django portal running which we'll
use as a development environment.

### Setup local Django portal development environment

To run the Django portal locally we'll start it as a Docker container. Another
option, which we won't cover in this tutorial, is to check out the code and run
the portal locally as a Python process (see the airavata-django-portal
[README](https://github.com/apache/airavata-django-portal/blob/master/README.md)
if you are interested).

1. Make sure you have
   [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Run the following to create a Docker container called
   **gateways19-tutorial**.

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/machristie/gateways19-tutorial.git
cd gateways19-tutorial
docker run -d --name gateways19-tutorial -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD:/extensions -v $PWD/settings_local.py:/code/django_airavata/settings_local.py machristie/airavata-django-portal
```

!!! note "For remote Docker host users"

    If you are using a remote Docker host (for example, you have Windows Home
    and can't install Docker Desktop), make sure you run the above commands
    on the remote Docker host. That means you need to
    `ssh USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS` to the remote host first. See [Appendix on
    running on a remote Docker
    host](#appendix-setting-up-windows-for-a-remote-docker-host) for more
    information on setting up the SSH connection. You can run the remaining
    `docker` commands on your own computer, but this `docker run` command
    must be run on the remote Docker host so that the tutorial files can be
    mounted into it.

!!! note

    You can also build the Docker image from scratch, which you might want to
    do if the Docker image is out-dated. To do that run the following:

        cd /tmp/
        git clone https://github.com/apache/airavata-django-portal.git
        cd airavata-django-portal
        docker build -t airavata-django-portal .

    Now you can `airavata-django-portal` instead of
    `machristie/airavata-django-portal` in the `docker run` command above.

3. Run the following to load the default set of CMS pages:

```
docker exec gateways19-tutorial python manage.py load_cms_data new_default_theme
```

Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), click on **Login in**,
enter your username and password. On the dashboard you should see the your
experiments listed on the right hand side.

### Setup the custom output viewer package

1. We've defined a custom output view provider, called
   GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider, in `output_views.py`. Open
   `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/output_views.py` in your
   editor and we'll look at how it is implemented. First we add some imports

```python
import io
import os

import numpy as np
from matplotlib.figure import Figure

from cclib.parser import ccopen

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
```

2. Next we define the GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider class, set some metadata
   attributes on the class. We set it's `display_type` to _image_ and give it a
   _name_:

```python
class GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider:
    display_type = 'image'
    name = "Gaussian Eigenvalues"
```

3. Now we implement the `generate_data` function. This function should return a
   dictionary with values that are expected for this `display_type`. For a
   display type of _image_, the required return values are _image_ which should
   be a bytes array or file-like object with the image bytes and _mime-type_
   which should be the image's mime type. Here's the `generate_data` function:

```python
    def generate_data(self, request, experiment_output, experiment, output_file=None):
        # Parse output_file
        output_text = io.TextIOWrapper(output_file)
        gaussian = ccopen(output_text)
        data = gaussian.parse()
        data.listify()
        homo_eigenvalues = None
        lumo_eigenvalues = None
        if hasattr(data, 'homos') and hasattr(data, 'moenergies'):
            homos = data.homos[0] + 1
            moenergies = data.moenergies[0]
            if homos > 9 and len(moenergies) >= homos:
                homo_eigenvalues = [data.moenergies[0][homos - 1 - i] for i in range(1, 10)]
            if homos + 9 <= len(moenergies):
                lumo_eigenvalues = [data.moenergies[0][homos + i] for i in range(1, 10)]

        # Create plot
        fig = Figure()
        if homo_eigenvalues and lumo_eigenvalues:
            fig.suptitle("Eigenvalues")
            ax = fig.subplots(2, 1)
            ax[0].plot(range(1, 10), homo_eigenvalues, label='Homo')
            ax[0].set_ylabel('eV')
            ax[0].legend()
            ax[1].plot(range(1, 10), lumo_eigenvalues, label='Lumo')
            ax[1].set_ylabel('eV')
            ax[1].legend()
        else:
            ax = fig.subplots()
            ax.text(0.5, 0.5, "No applicable data", horizontalalignment='center',
                verticalalignment='center', transform=ax.transAxes)

        # Export plot as image buffer
        buffer = io.BytesIO()
        fig.savefig(buffer, format='png')
        image_bytes = buffer.getvalue()
        buffer.close()

        # return dictionary with image data
        return {
            'image': image_bytes,
            'mime-type': 'image/png'
        }
```

This plots the eigenvalues of molecular orbital energies calculated by Gaussian.
`cclib` is a Python computational chemistry library which is used to read the
molecular orbital energies. Then `matplotlib` is used to create two plots of
these values. Finally, the plots are exported as a PNG image that is returns as
a buffer of bytes.

4. Altogether, the output_views.py file should have the following contents:

```python
import io
import os

import numpy as np
from matplotlib.figure import Figure

from cclib.parser import ccopen

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

class GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider:
    display_type = 'image'
    name = "Gaussian Eigenvalues"

    def generate_data(self, request, experiment_output, experiment, output_file=None):

        # Parse output_file
        output_text = io.TextIOWrapper(output_file)
        gaussian = ccopen(output_text)
        data = gaussian.parse()
        data.listify()
        homo_eigenvalues = None
        lumo_eigenvalues = None
        if hasattr(data, 'homos') and hasattr(data, 'moenergies'):
            homos = data.homos[0] + 1
            moenergies = data.moenergies[0]
            if homos > 9 and len(moenergies) >= homos:
                homo_eigenvalues = [data.moenergies[0][homos - 1 - i] for i in range(1, 10)]
            if homos + 9 <= len(moenergies):
                lumo_eigenvalues = [data.moenergies[0][homos + i] for i in range(1, 10)]

        # Create plot
        fig = Figure()
        if homo_eigenvalues and lumo_eigenvalues:
            fig.suptitle("Eigenvalues")
            ax = fig.subplots(2, 1)
            ax[0].plot(range(1, 10), homo_eigenvalues, label='Homo')
            ax[0].set_ylabel('eV')
            ax[0].legend()
            ax[1].plot(range(1, 10), lumo_eigenvalues, label='Lumo')
            ax[1].set_ylabel('eV')
            ax[1].legend()
        else:
            ax = fig.subplots()
            ax.text(0.5, 0.5, "No applicable data", horizontalalignment='center',
                verticalalignment='center', transform=ax.transAxes)

        # Export plot as image buffer
        buffer = io.BytesIO()
        fig.savefig(buffer, format='png')
        image_bytes = buffer.getvalue()
        buffer.close()

        # return dictionary with image data
        return {
            'image': image_bytes,
            'mime-type': 'image/png'
        }

```

5. Now we need to register our _output view provider_ with the package metadata
   so that the Django Portal will be able to discover it. We add the following
   lines to the `entry_points` parameter in the
   `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/setup.py` file:

```python
setuptools.setup(
# ...
    entry_points="""
[airavata.output_view_providers]
gaussian-eigenvalues-plot = gateways19_tutorial.output_views:GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider
""",
)
```

`gaussian-eigenvalues-plot` is the output view provider id.
`gateways19_tutorial.output_views` is the module in which the
`GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider` output view provider class is found.

6. Now we need to install the _gateways19-tutorial_ package into the Django
   portal's virtual environment.

```bash
docker exec -w /extensions gateways19-tutorial pip install -r requirements.txt
docker exec -w /extensions gateways19-tutorial python setup.py develop
docker exec gateways19-tutorial touch /code/django_airavata/wsgi.py
```

These commands:

1. install our package's dependencies,
2. install the package into the container's Python environment, and
3. touches the wsgi.py to trigger a reload of the Django portal dev server.

### Use the GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider with the Gaussian log output file

Back in the Django Portal, we'll make sure the application interface for
Gaussian is configured to add the GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider as an
additional output view of the file.

1. Log into your local Django Portal instance at <http://localhost:8000>.
2. In the menu at the top, select **Settings**.
3. Click on the **Gaussian16** application.
4. Click on the **Interface** tab.
5. Scroll down to the _Output Field: Gaussian-Application-Output_.
6. Verify that the following is in the _Metadata_ section:

```json
{
    "output-view-providers": ["gaussian-eigenvalues-plot"]
}
```

It should look something like this:

![Screenshot of Gaussian log output-view-providers json](./screenshots/gateways19/gaussian-output-view-providers-json.png)

7. Go back to the **Workspace** using the menu at the top.
8. Select your Gaussian16 experiment from the right sidebar.
9. For the .log output file there should be a dropdown menu allowing you to
   select an alternate view. Select **Gaussian Eigenvalues**. Now you should see
   the image generated by the custom output view provider.

### (Optional) Interactive parameter

In additional to producing static visualizations, output view providers can
declare interactive parameters that can be manipulated by the user. We can add a
simple boolean interactive parameter to toggle the display of the matplotlib
grid as an example.

1. Open `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/output_views.py`. Change
   the `generate_data` function so that it has an additional `show_grid`
   parameter with a default value of `False`:

```python
    def generate_data(self, request, experiment_output, experiment, output_file=None, show_grid=False):
```

2. Add the following `.grid()` lines to the matplotlib code:

```python
...
            fig.suptitle("Eigenvalues")
            ax = fig.subplots(2, 1)
            ax[0].plot(range(1, 10), homo_eigenvalues, label='Homo')
            ax[0].set_ylabel('eV')
            ax[0].legend()
            ax[0].grid(show_grid)
            ax[1].plot(range(1, 10), lumo_eigenvalues, label='Lumo')
            ax[1].set_ylabel('eV')
            ax[1].legend()
            ax[1].grid(show_grid)
...
```

3. Change the resulting dictionary to have the special `interactive` property
   and declare the `show_grid` parameter:

```python
...
        # return dictionary with image data
        return {
            'image': image_bytes,
            'mime-type': 'image/png'
            'interactive': [
                {'name': 'show_grid', 'value': show_grid}
            ]
        }
```

This will provider the user with a checkbox for manipulating the show_grid
parameter. Every time the user changes it, the GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider
will be again invoked. It should look something like the following:

![Gaussian Eigenvalues View Provider with interactive parameter](./screenshots/gateways19/gaussian-eigenvalues-show_grid.png)

There are several more interactive parameter types and additional options. You
can learn more about them in the
[custom output view provider documentation](../dev/custom_output_view_provider.md#interactive-parameters).

## Tutorial exercise: Create a custom Django app

In this tutorial exercise we'll create a fully custom user interface that lives
within the Django Portal.

What we're going to build is a very simple user interface that will:

-   allow a user to pick a greeting in one of several languages
-   submit a simple _echo_ job to a batch scheduler to echo that greeting
-   display the echoed greeting by displaying the STDOUT file produced by the
    job

This is an intentionally simple example to demonstrate the general principle of
using custom REST APIs and UI to setup, execute and post-process/visualize the
output of a computational experiment.

We've already registered the _Echo_ application with the portal, meaning we
registered its interface and on which compute resource it is deployed.

A
[Django _application_ or _app_](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/applications/)
is a Python package that may include Django views, url mappings, models, etc.
It's a way of creating a kind of plug-in that integrates with a Django server.
We'll create this custom user interface by developing a Django app that uses the
Django framework as well as the Airavata Django Portal REST APIs and JS library.

### Setting up the Django app

To start, we'll just create a simple "Hello World" page for the Django app and
get it properly registered with the local Django Portal instance.

1. In the `gateways19-tutorial` directory, open
   `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/templates/gateways19_tutorial/hello.html`.
   Some of the HTML view is commented out. The following is the uncommented
   content:

```xml
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<div class="main-content-wrapper">
    <main class="main-content">
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </div>
    </main>
</div>
{% endblock content %}
```

2. Open the file `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/apps.py`:

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig


class Gateways19TutorialAppConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'gateways19_tutorial'
    label = name
    verbose_name = "Gateways Tutorial"
    fa_icon_class = "fa-comment"
```

This the main metadata for this custom Django app. Besides the normal metadata
that the Django framework expects, this also defines a display name
(`verbose_name`) and an icon (`fa_icon_class`) to use for this custom app.

3. Open the file `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/views.py`:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required


@login_required
def hello_world(request):
    return render(request, "gateways19_tutorial/hello.html")
```

This view will simply display the template created in the previous step.

4. Open the file `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/urls.py`:

```python
from django.conf.urls import url, include

from . import views

app_name = 'gateways19_tutorial'
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^hello/', views.hello_world, name="home"),
]
```

This maps the `/hello/` URL to the `hello_world` view.

5. We've created the necessary code for our Django app to display the hello
   world page, but now we need to add some metadata to this Python package so
   that the Django Portal knows about this Django app. In
   `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/setup.py`, we add the following
   `[airavata.djangoapp]` metadata to the entry_points section:

```python
setuptools.setup(
# ...
    entry_points="""
[airavata.output_view_providers]
gaussian-eigenvalues-plot = gateways19_tutorial.output_views:GaussianEigenvaluesViewProvider
[airavata.djangoapp]
gateways19_tutorial = gateways19_tutorial.apps:Gateways19TutorialAppConfig
""",
)
```

---

Now you should be able to [log into the portal locally](http://localhost:8000)
and see **Gateways Tutorial** in the drop down menu in the header (click on
**Workspace** then you should see it in that menu).

![Screenshot of custom app in menu](./screenshots/gateways19/custom-app-menu.png)

### Adding a list of "Hello" greetings

Now we'll create a REST endpoint in our custom Django app that will return
greetings in several languages.

1. In the `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/views.py` file, we add
   the following import:

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
```

2. Also we add the following view:

```python
@login_required
def languages(request):
    return JsonResponse({'languages': [{
        'lang': 'French',
        'greeting': 'bonjour',
    }, {
        'lang': 'German',
        'greeting': 'guten tag'
    }, {
        'lang': 'Hindi',
        'greeting': 'namaste'
    }, {
        'lang': 'Japanese',
        'greeting': 'konnichiwa'
    }, {
        'lang': 'Swahili',
        'greeting': 'jambo'
    }, {
        'lang': 'Turkish',
        'greeting': 'merhaba'
    }]})
```

3. In `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/urls.py` we add a url
   mapping for the `languages` view:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^hello/', views.hello_world, name="home"),
    url(r'^languages/', views.languages, name="languages"),
]
```

4. In
   `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/templates/gateways19_tutorial/hello.html`,
   uncomment the comment that starts `<!-- Adding a list of "Hello" greetings`
   on line 11 and ends on line 21. That is, just delete lines 11 and 21. This
   adds a `<select>` element to the template which will be used to display the
   greeting options:

```html
...
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">Run "echo" for different languages</div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <select id="greeting-select"></select>
        <button id="run-button" class="btn btn-primary">Run</button>
    </div>
</div>
...
```

5. We also add the `{% load static %}` directive and then a `scripts` block to
   the end of `hello.html`. This will load the AiravataAPI JavaScript library
   which has utilities for interacting with the Django portal's REST API (which
   can also be used for custom developed REST endpoints) and model classes for
   Airavata's data models. The `utils.FetchUtils` is used to load the languages
   REST endpoint.

```xml
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% load static %}

...
{% endblock content %}

{% block scripts %}
<script src="{% static 'django_airavata_api/dist/airavata-api.js' %}"></script>
<script>
    const { models, services, session, utils } = AiravataAPI;

    utils.FetchUtils.get("/gateways19_tutorial/languages/").then(data => {
        data.languages.forEach(language => {
            $("#greeting-select").append(
                `<option value="${language.greeting}">
                    ${language.lang} - "${language.greeting}"
                 </option>`
            );
        });
    });
</script>
{% endblock scripts %}
```

Now when you view the custom app at
[http://localhost:8000/gateways19_tutorial/hello/](http://localhost:8000/gateways19_tutorial/hello/)
you should see a dropdown of greetings in several languages, like so:

![Screenshot of custom app with languages list](./screenshots/gateways19/custom-app-languages-list.png)

### Displaying a list of recent experiments

Now we'll use the `AiravataAPI` library to load the user's recent experiments.

1. In
   `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/templates/gateways19_tutorial/hello.html`,
   uncomment the comment that begins with
   `<!-- Displaying a list of recent experiments` on line 21 or so and ends on
   line 45. This adds table to display recent experiments to the bottom of
   `hello.html`:

```xml
...
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-header">
                    Run "echo" for different languages
                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <select id="greeting-select"></select>
                    <button id="run-button" class="btn btn-primary">Run</button>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-header">
                    Experiments
                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <button id="refresh-button" class="btn btn-secondary">Refresh</button>
                    <table class="table">
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="col">Name</th>
                                <th scope="col">Application</th>
                                <th scope="col">Creation Time</th>
                                <th scope="col">Status</th>
                                <th scope="col">Output</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody id="experiment-list">
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </main>
</div>
{% endblock content %}
```

2. Now we'll use the ExperimentSearchService to load the user's most recent 5
   _Echo_ experiments and display them in the table. We add the following to the
   end of the _scripts_ block in `hello.html`:

```javascript
// ...
    const appInterfaceId = "Echo_23d67491-1bef-47bd-a0f5-faf069e09773";

    function loadExperiments() {

        return services.ExperimentSearchService
            .list({limit: 5,
                [models.ExperimentSearchFields.USER_NAME.name]: session.Session.username,
                [models.ExperimentSearchFields.APPLICATION_ID.name]: appInterfaceId,
            })
            .then(data => {
                $('#experiment-list').empty();
                data.results.forEach((exp, index) => {
                    $('#experiment-list').append(
                    `<tr>
                        <td>${exp.name}</td>
                        <td>${exp.executionId}</td>
                        <td>${exp.creationTime}</td>
                        <td>${exp.experimentStatus.name}</td>
                        <td id="output_${index}"></td>
                    </tr>`);
                });
        });
    }

    loadExperiments();
    $("#refresh-button").click(loadExperiments);

</script>

{% endblock scripts %}
```

The user interface should now look something like:

![Screenshot of list of recent Echo experiments](./screenshots/gateways19/custom-app-experiment-list.png)

### Submitting an Echo job

Now we'll use `AiravataAPI` to submit an Echo job.

1. In
   `$HOME/gateways19-tutorial/gateways19_tutorial/templates/gateways19_tutorial/hello.html`
   we add a click handler to the _Run_ button that gets the selected greeting
   value:

```javascript
$("#run-button").click((e) => {
    const greeting = $("#greeting-select").val();
});
```

2. There are a couple key pieces of information that are needed to submit a
   computational experiment. We can use the REST API to find these. The
   application we want to use is called Echo and it has id
   `Echo_37eb38ac-74c8-4aa4-a037-c656ab5bc6b8`. We can browse the API for this
   application using:
   <https://testdrive.airavata.org/api/applications/Echo_37eb38ac-74c8-4aa4-a037-c656ab5bc6b8/>.
   First, we need the _Application Interface_ for the application, which defines
   the inputs and outputs of the application. We can get its id by following the
   link to `applicationInterface`:
   <https://testdrive.airavata.org/api/applications/Echo_37eb38ac-74c8-4aa4-a037-c656ab5bc6b8/application_interface/>.
   We'll create an _Experiment_ instance from the _Application Interface_
   definition:

```javascript
const loadAppInterface = services.ApplicationInterfaceService.retrieve({
    lookup: appInterfaceId,
});
```

3. Second, we need to know where and how the application is deployed. We could
   let the user then pick where they want to run this application. For this
   exercise we're going to hard code the resource and the application deployment
   that will be used for executing the application, but we still need the
   application deployment information so we can get default values for the
   application that can be used when submitting the job to that scheduler. The
   application deployment id we get from
   <https://testdrive.airavata.org/api/applications/Echo_37eb38ac-74c8-4aa4-a037-c656ab5bc6b8/application_deployments/>.

```javascript
const appDeploymentId =
    "example-vc.jetstream-cloud.org_Echo_37eb38ac-74c8-4aa4-a037-c656ab5bc6b8";
const loadQueues = services.ApplicationDeploymentService.getQueues({
    lookup: appDeploymentId,
});
```

4. We also need to know a few other pieces of information, like the id of the
   compute resource which
   <https://testdrive.airavata.org/api/applications/Echo_37eb38ac-74c8-4aa4-a037-c656ab5bc6b8/application_deployments/>
   also provides with the value `computeHostId`. The queue name we can get from
   following the link from the deployment to the queues:
   <https://testdrive.airavata.org/api/application-deployments/example-vc.jetstream-cloud.org_Echo_37eb38ac-74c8-4aa4-a037-c656ab5bc6b8/queues/>.
   Here we see that the `queueName` is `cloud`. We also need the account to use
   to submit the job and that is specified via a "Group Resource Profile".
   <https://testdrive.airavata.org/api/group-resource-profiles/> lists profiles
   you have access to and the compute resources each profile can use for job
   submission. We'll use the tutorial reservation one. Finally, experiments are
   organized by projects so we'll also load the user's most recently used
   project which is stored in the user's WorkspacePreferences:

```javascript
const resourceHostId =
    "example-vc.jetstream-cloud.org_794fd026-101a-46af-8868-5d7a86f813a1";
const queueName = "cloud";
const groupResourceProfileId = "fc245311-a7d1-41af-b8ae-a4142989c9a1";
const loadWorkspacePrefs = services.WorkspacePreferencesService.get();
```

5. Once we have all of this information we can then create an `Experiment`
   object then _save_ and _launch_ it. Here's the complete click handler:

```javascript
$("#run-button").click((e) => {
    const greeting = $("#greeting-select").val();
    const loadAppInterface = services.ApplicationInterfaceService.retrieve({
        lookup: appInterfaceId,
    });
    const appDeploymentId =
        "example-vc.jetstream-cloud.org_Echo_37eb38ac-74c8-4aa4-a037-c656ab5bc6b8";
    const loadQueues = services.ApplicationDeploymentService.getQueues({
        lookup: appDeploymentId,
    });
    const resourceHostId =
        "example-vc.jetstream-cloud.org_794fd026-101a-46af-8868-5d7a86f813a1";
    const queueName = "cloud";
    const groupResourceProfileId = "fc245311-a7d1-41af-b8ae-a4142989c9a1";
    const loadWorkspacePrefs = services.WorkspacePreferencesService.get();
    Promise.all([loadAppInterface, loadWorkspacePrefs, loadQueues])
        .then(([appInterface, workspacePrefs, queues]) => {
            const experiment = appInterface.createExperiment();
            experiment.experimentName = "Echo " + greeting;
            experiment.projectId = workspacePrefs.most_recent_project_id;
            const cloudQueue = queues.find((q) => q.queueName === queueName);
            experiment.userConfigurationData.groupResourceProfileId = groupResourceProfileId;
            experiment.userConfigurationData.computationalResourceScheduling.resourceHostId = resourceHostId;
            experiment.userConfigurationData.computationalResourceScheduling.totalCPUCount =
                cloudQueue.defaultCPUCount;
            experiment.userConfigurationData.computationalResourceScheduling.nodeCount =
                cloudQueue.defaultNodeCount;
            experiment.userConfigurationData.computationalResourceScheduling.wallTimeLimit =
                cloudQueue.defaultWalltime;
            experiment.userConfigurationData.computationalResourceScheduling.queueName = queueName;
            // Copy the selected greeting to the value of the first input
            experiment.experimentInputs[0].value = greeting;

            return services.ExperimentService.create({ data: experiment });
        })
        .then((exp) => {
            return services.ExperimentService.launch({
                lookup: exp.experimentId,
            });
        });
});
```

Now that we can launch the experiment we can go ahead and give it a try.

You can also try this out in the production deployment at
<https://testdrive.airavata.org/gateways19_tutorial/hello/>.

### Displaying the experiment output

Instead of simply reporting the status of the job we would also like to do
something with the output. The STDOUT of the Echo job has a format like the
following:

```
bonjour
```

We'll read the STDOUT file and display that in our experiment listing table.

1. What we need to do is get the identifier for the experiment's STDOUT file. In
   Airavata, this identifier is called the _Data Product ID_. Once we have that
   we can get the DataProduct object which has the files metadata, including a
   `downloadURL`. For each `exp` we can use the `FullExperimentService` to get
   these details like so:

```javascript
if (exp.experimentStatus === models.ExperimentState.COMPLETED) {
    services.FullExperimentService.retrieve({ lookup: exp.experimentId }).then(
        (fullDetails) => {
            const stdoutDataProductId = fullDetails.experiment.experimentOutputs.find(
                (o) => o.name === "Echo-STDOUT"
            ).value;
            const stdoutDataProduct = fullDetails.outputDataProducts.find(
                (dp) => dp.productUri === stdoutDataProductId
            );
            if (stdoutDataProduct && stdoutDataProduct.downloadURL) {
                return fetch(stdoutDataProduct.downloadURL, {
                    credentials: "same-origin",
                }).then((result) => result.text());
            }
        }
    );
}
```

2. Then we'll simply display the value in the table.

```javascript
if (exp.experimentStatus === models.ExperimentState.COMPLETED) {
    services.FullExperimentService.retrieve({ lookup: exp.experimentId })
        .then((fullDetails) => {
            const stdoutDataProductId = fullDetails.experiment.experimentOutputs.find(
                (o) => o.name === "Echo-STDOUT"
            ).value;
            const stdoutDataProduct = fullDetails.outputDataProducts.find(
                (dp) => dp.productUri === stdoutDataProductId
            );
            if (stdoutDataProduct && stdoutDataProduct.downloadURL) {
                return fetch(stdoutDataProduct.downloadURL, {
                    credentials: "same-origin",
                }).then((result) => result.text());
            }
        })
        .then((text) => {
            $(`#output_${index}`).text(text);
        });
}
```

   Here's the update to the `loadExperiments` function:

```javascript
function loadExperiments() {
    return services.ExperimentSearchService.list({
        limit: 5,
        [models.ExperimentSearchFields.USER_NAME.name]:
            session.Session.username,
        [models.ExperimentSearchFields.APPLICATION_ID.name]: appInterfaceId,
    }).then((data) => {
        $("#experiment-list").empty();
        data.results.forEach((exp, index) => {
            $("#experiment-list").append(
                `<tr>
                            <td>${exp.name}</td>
                            <td>${exp.executionId}</td>

                            <td>${exp.experimentStatus.name}</td>
                            <td id="output_${index}"></td>
                        </tr>`
            );
            // If experiment has finished, load full details, then parse the stdout file
            if (exp.experimentStatus === models.ExperimentState.COMPLETED) {
                services.FullExperimentService.retrieve({
                    lookup: exp.experimentId,
                })

                        ).value;
                        const stdoutDataProduct = fullDetails.outputDataProducts.find(
                            (dp) => dp.productUri === stdoutDataProductId
                        );
                        if (
                            stdoutDataProduct &&
                            stdoutDataProduct.downloadURL
                        ) {

### Airavata API

The Django portal provides a REST API bridge to the backend Airavata API. So
it's helpful to look at what is available in the backend Airavata API. See the
[Apache Airavata API docs](https://airavata.readthedocs.io/en/master/technical-documentation/airavata-api/)

To see what is in the `AiravataAPI` JavaScript library, take a look at it's
[index.js](https://github.com/apache/airavata-django-portal/blob/master/django_airavata/apps/api/static/django_airavata_api/js/index.js)
file in the
[airavata-django-portal repo](https://github.com/apache/airavata-django-portal).

### Airavata Gateway Hosting

SciGaP provides free Airavata Gateways hosting services. Log in or create an
account at [scigap.org](https://scigap.org/) to request gateway hosting.

## Appendix: Setting up Windows for a **remote Docker host**

### Installing Visual Studio Code

The tutorial code needs to be on the remote Docker host so that it can be
mounted into the Django portal container. To modify the files as required by the
tutorial you'll need to either SSH into the remote Docker host and edit the
files there with a terminal editor, like Vim, or you can use
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit the files remotely
with the SSH extension.

To use Visual Studio Code, install it from <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.
Once you have it installed, start it. In the menu, go to **View > Extensions**.
In the Extensions search, type `ssh` and click on **Install** for the _Remote -
SSH_ extension. Once it is installed, click on the green box in the lower left
hand corner and select **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...**, or, type
`Ctrl-Shift-P` and type `Remote-SSH` and select **Remote-SSH: Connect to
Host...**. Select **linux** as the remote platform type.

Once you are connected, go to **View > Explorer**. Click on the **Open Folder**
button. Select the folder that contains the tutorial code and click **OK**. You
should now see the tutorial files in the Explorer on the left hand side. Now you
can edit the tutorial files from your local computer and they will be
immediately reflected in the Django portal container.

### SSH configuration

To connect via SSH to the remote Docker host, you'll need an SSH key pair. If
you are setting up the remote Docker host, you can create the key pair yourself
and copy the public portion to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file under the user
account on the remote Docker host. For the in person tutorial session this will
have already been setup and you will be provided with the private key.

1. Create a directory in your home directory (i.e. `C:\Users\<username>\`)
   called `.ssh`.
2. Copy the private key file into the `.ssh` directory.
3. Create (or if provided, copy) a `config` file in the `.ssh` directory. The
   contents of the file should be:

```
Host IP_ADDRESS
    IdentityFile ~\.ssh\PRIVATE_KEY
```

Where IP_ADDRESS should be replaced with the IP address or hostname of the
remote Docker host (for example: `149.165.168.201`). And PRIVATE_KEY should be
replaced with the name of your private key file that you copied in step 2.

Test that SSH is working by opening a Powershell command prompt (in Visual
Studio Code open a new terminal with **Ctrl+Shift+`**) and running the
following:

```
ssh username@IP_ADDRESS
```

You should see something like the following:

```text
PS C:\Users\testuser> ssh user1@149.165.157.132
The authenticity of host '149.165.157.132 (149.165.157.132)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:RG86D7KwCZNQtFOAfEc4TZ4V0stn1RyGrj5I+v7SHxU.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '149.165.157.132' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Last login: Thu Aug 20 14:31:41 2020 from 156-56-142-122.dhcp-bl.indiana.edu
[user1@django-tutorial ~]$
```

If you get the "authenticity of host ... can't be established", as shown above,
enter `yes` at the prompt to proceed. You shouldn't be prompted for a password
since the private key will be used for authentication. If you are prompted for a
password, double check that the `config` file is correct.

### Connecting to Docker

To connect to Docker you'll need the Docker client. Download
<https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-cli-builder/releases/download/19.03.12/docker.exe>
and copy it to `C:\Windows` (or anywhere else that is on your PATH, or in the
current directory).

Next, at a Powershell command prompt set the environment variable `DOCKER_HOST`
to the SSH username and IP address of the remote Docker host.

```
$env:DOCKER_HOST = "ssh://USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS"
```

But replace USERNAME with your username on the remote Docker host and the
IP_ADDRESS with the IP address or domain name of the remote Docker host. For
example:

```
$env:DOCKER_HOST = "ssh://train01@149.165.170.99"
```

Now run the following to test that the connection is working:

```
docker ps
```

You'll use this command prompt window during the tutorial to run docker
commands.

!!! note "Note for legacy Command Prompt users"

    If you are using `CMD`, the legacy command prompt program then you need a
    slightly different way of specifying the DOCKER_HOST environment
    variable. The form is

    ```
    set DOCKER_HOST=ssh://USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
    ```

### SSH Tunnel

For some of the tutorial instructions you'll be asked to load the Django portal
in your browser at <http://localhost:8000>. However, your Django portal
container is running on a remote Docker host, not your local computer. To make
it appear that the Django portal is running locally, create an SSH tunnel to
forward port 8000 to the remote Docker host. In a separate command prompt (in
Visual Studio Code open a new terminal with **Ctrl+Shift+`**), run the
following:

```
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
```
