This project is for RNA-Nanostructures researchers who work with the RNAMake application which provides solutions to a host of RNA 3D nanostructure challenges, the RNA-Nanostructures Science Gateway is a web-interface that provides a user-friendly experience with the RNAMake application and enables job scheduling on the Open Science Grid or Holland Computing Center. Furthermore, the RNA-Nanostructures science gateway, enables visualization of results through an easy-to-use web interface.
