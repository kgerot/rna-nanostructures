# Testing Strategy
- Back-end systems should have unit tests that can test components of the system
  - Come up with tests based on user-stories (requirements)
  - Development should follow test-driven development.
- All user-interfaces have user testing integrated.
- Continuous Integration for pull request:
  - Meeting naming conventions and style (linters)
  - Code compilation
  - Unit tests pass
